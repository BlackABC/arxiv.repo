## Introduction
A collection of papers and their corresponding repositories for indexing papers on arxiv that have published project code or coming soon.

We hope that the authors of the relevant papers will actively add and update information here as a list to promote broader and more comprehensive discussions.

## Contribution
Such a file naming format is conducive to retrieval and classification.
```
repo.cs.CV.md
repo.cs.AI.md
```
Newer papers should be inserted from the head of the file.

Item format example:
- **title**
   - author
   - paper
   - repo

## Proposals
Consider whether Python crawlers can be used to automatically capture and generate MD files.
